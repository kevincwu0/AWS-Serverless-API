# AWS-Serverless-API

Introduction: 
1. What's AWS?
- Amazon Web Services - AWS offers a broad-range of cloud computing services which means services using their infrastructure which is hosted on various datacenters all over the world which one can rent to run your own solutions/apps.
  - Cloud hosting
    - EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing
  - Storage
    - Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - Networking and Content Delivery
    - CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing
2. What's Serverless Computing is?
  - Traditional Web Hosting - apps (web & mobile)
    - REST API for client to exchange data
      - run business logic
      - access database
      - server could serve HTML page
  - Serverless Computing shines when you have a decoupled frontend and backend
  - backend is such an API, frontend (mobile or web)
  - How does code on the server run? 
    - Write our own code to listen to incoming requests on certain API endpoints
    - URL for services to sent requests to
    - runs on a servers, provision with EC2, virtual machine
    - scaling we need more servers - AWS or our own
      - Issue: re-invent the wheel to creating the API
        - logic to handle incoming requests, incoming endpoints in code
        - infrastructure and not business logic
      - Issue: Servers are online even if not requested
        - danger of over or under provisioning
          - too many (pay too much), or not enough for traffic spikes
      - Issue: Over and Under provisioning
      - Issue: Keep OS & Software Updated of Servers
        - don't break
    - Challenges above of managing our own servers
  - Serverless Apps
    - AWS Lambda Service host our code and allows us to execute on demand when needed
    - We don't have to worry about how many servers we need, we don't need to pay idle time
    - Only pay if requests are coming in and don't need to update software
    - node.js, python, java, C# lambda - serverless API
    - host our web page in a serverless manner.
  - Traditional vs Serverless
    - (Traditional) - Provision capacity, server capacity (CPU, RAM, Memory)
    - (Traditional) - scaling (pay too much on server issues)
    - (Traditional) Update OS and Software, security issues 
    - (Traditional) - lots of overhead for SPA + API apps, great support for fullstack apps, no seperation has great support
    - (Serverless) - Runs on demand, unlimited capacity, only pay for code executions
    - (Serverless) - Scales automatically - pay what you need
    - (Serverless) - runs in up-to-date and secure environment
    - (Serverless) - great for SPA + API apps, limited support for fullstack apps (node/express apps)
 - API Gateway
    - New API, first-api
    - define all the resources API, HTTP methods in editor
    - there are advanced ways of creating such an API (importing API definition files) 
    - Resources -> Actions -> Create Resource
      - define which HTTP request to react, actions -> create method (GET)
        - Lambda Function, HTTP endpoint, Mock, AWS Service
        - Mock (Dummy data)
        - Integration response -> Body Mapping Templates
    - Deploy API
      - Actions -> Deploy API
      - Stage different versions 
      - Deploy with invoke URL
      - Missing auth token because not handling root, change to api endpoint
      - JSON object, API Gateway 
  - Why AWS?
    - Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform
    - Market Leader, Aggressive Pricing
    - Most Serverless Services (allow elaborate apps)
    - Rapid Innovation and New Features
    - Cutting-edge technologies
- Structure
  - Core Serverless Services (which is required for serverless app)
  - Business Logic with Lambda and API Gateway
  - Data Storage with DynamoDB
  - Authentication with Cognito, protect against unauthenticated accoess
  - Content Delivery and Hosting with S3, CloudFront, and Route53 => Web apps in a serverless manner
  - Beyond the Basics (Outlook) 

3. Core AWS Serverless Services
  - Which AWS services we need to use to build a serverless solution
  - Which services do we need?
    - We can do more than host backend
    - Web app, can host on AWS and scale dynamically, don't have to provision capacities
      - Serve Static App (React.js App) -> S3 (Simple Storage Service), File storage server, no server-side code, no capacities
      - REST API -> API Gateway - service that makes it easy to create paths and HTTP methods
      - Logic -> Execute code on demand -> Lambda, custom API endpoint
      - Data -> Store and Retrieve Data (DB) -> DynamoDB (NoSQL) - don't want to manage DB Servers, don't need to provision
      - Auth -> Authenticate Users -> Cognito, easily create user pools to signups/signin and protect REST API
      - DNS -> Translate URL -> Route 53, configure our own domain we actually load from S3 buckets
      - Cache -> Improve Performance (e.g. caching) -> CloudFront, all over the world copied to have the quickest route possible
    - For backend (API, Logic, Data, Auth)
